 Here are the most common Java classes that implement the Queue interface, along with their key features and typical use cases:

Common Queue Implementations in Java
1. LinkedList
Implements: Queue, Deque, List
Type: Doubly linked list
Supports all queue operations + deque (double-ended queue) operations
Order: FIFO (First-In-First-Out) for queue methods

Use case: General-purpose queue, also supports stack and deque operations


Queue<String> queue = new LinkedList<>();
queue.add("A");
queue.offer("B");
System.out.println(queue.poll()); // Outputs "A"


2. ArrayDeque
Implements: Deque, Queue
Type: Resizable array-based deque
Faster than LinkedList for most queue/deque operations (no node allocations)
Use case: High-performance queue and deque
Does not allow capacity restrictions (no blocking or bounded behavior)

Queue<String> queue = new ArrayDeque<>();
queue.offer("X");
queue.offer("Y");
System.out.println(queue.poll()); // Outputs "X"


3. PriorityQueue
Implements: Queue
Type: Heap-based priority queue
Order: Elements are ordered based on natural ordering or provided Comparator
Use case: When you want a queue that dequeues the smallest or highest priority element first (not FIFO)



Queue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
pq.offer(20);
pq.offer(10);
pq.offer(15);
System.out.println(pq.poll()); // Outputs 10 (smallest element)


4. ConcurrentLinkedQueue
Implements: Queue
Type: Lock-free, thread-safe queue
Order: FIFO
Use case: High-performance, non-blocking concurrent queue for multi-threading


Queue<String> concurrentQueue = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue<>();
concurrentQueue.offer("thread-safe");



5. LinkedBlockingQueue (from java.util.concurrent)
Implements: BlockingQueue, Queue
Type: Thread-safe, optionally bounded blocking queue
Use case: Producer-consumer pattern, thread communication with blocking

BlockingQueue<String> blockingQueue = new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(100);
blockingQueue.put("data");  // blocks if full
blockingQueue.take();       // blocks if empty



Summary Table
Class	Thread-Safe?	Blocking?	Ordering	Use Case
LinkedList	No	No	FIFO	General-purpose queue & deque
ArrayDeque	No	No	FIFO	Fast, general queue & deque
PriorityQueue	No	No	Priority-based (not FIFO)	Priority ordering queue
ConcurrentLinkedQueue	Yes	No	FIFO	High-performance concurrent queue
LinkedBlockingQueue	Yes	Yes	FIFO	Thread-safe blocking queue (producer-consumer)
