âœ… Answer:
Actually, Set adds no new methods of its own.

ðŸ“Œ Explanation:
Set is a subinterface of Collection, and it does not declare any new methods.

It inherits all of its methods from Collection.

The key difference is in the behavior:

Set does not allow duplicate elements.

Method implementations (like add, equals, hashCode, etc.) are expected to enforce that set elements are unique.


This is the internal Implementation

public class Set<E> implements Collection<E> {
    private List<E> data = new ArrayList<>();

    @Override
    public boolean add(E e) {
        if (!data.contains(e)) {
            data.add(e);
            return true;
        }
        return false; // duplicate
    }
}
